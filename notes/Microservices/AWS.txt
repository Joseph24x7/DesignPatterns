1. Why AWS:

	- AWS or Amazon Web Services is a cloud computing platform that offers on-demand computing services such as virtual servers and storage that can be used to build and run applications and websites. 
	- AWS is known for its security, reliability, and flexibility, which makes it a popular choice for organizations that need to store and process sensitive data.

2. Advantages of Amazon Web Services
	- auto scaling
	- highly reliable and secure infrastructure, with multiple data centers and a commitment to 99.99% availability for many of its services.
	- highly flexible - wide range of services and tools
	- AWS offers a pay-as-you-go pricing model

3. AWS Cloud Computing Models:

There are three cloud computing models available on AWS.

	- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): It is the basic building block of cloud IT. It generally provides access to data storage space, networking features, and computer hardware(virtual or dedicated hardware). It is highly flexible and gives management controls over the IT resources to the developer. For example, VPC, EC2, EBS.
	
	- Platform as a Service (PaaS): This is a type of service where AWS manages the underlying infrastructure (usually operating system and hardware). This helps the developer to be more efficient as they do not have to worry about undifferentiated heavy lifting required for running the applications such as capacity planning, software maintenance, resource procurement, patching, etc., and focus more on deployment and management of the applications. For example, RDS, EMR, ElasticSearch.
	
	- Software as a Service(SaaS): It is a complete product that usually runs on a browser. It primarily refers to end-user applications. It is run and managed by the service provider. The end-user only has to worry about the application of the software suitable to its needs. For example, Saleforce.com, Web-based email, Office 365 .

4. EC instance: (Part of IAAS)

	- The purpose of an EC2 instance is to provide you with computing resources on demand. You can use it to run applications, host websites, process data, or perform any other computing tasks. It's like having your own virtual computer in the cloud that you can configure and use based on your specific needs. EC2 instances are part of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and offer flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness for various computing requirements.
	
	- When you launch an EC2 instance, it typically starts with a clean, basic operating system (such as Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, or others), and it doesn't come pre-installed with Docker by default. However, you have the flexibility to install and configure Docker on an EC2 instance based on your requirements.

5. 
Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) is a fully managed container orchestration service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). ECS makes it easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster. Containers are a lightweight, portable, and consistent way to package and run applications and their dependencies.
